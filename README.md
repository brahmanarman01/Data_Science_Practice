# Data_Science_Practice
Data_Science_Practice is a repository where I document my journey in learning data science. It includes projects on data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning, model evaluation, and deep learning. I use tools like Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch
