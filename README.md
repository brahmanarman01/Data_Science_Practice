Data_Science_Practice

This repository is a collection of my personal Data Science practice exercises, projects, and learning notes. As I explore and deepen my understanding of various data science concepts, algorithms, and tools, I will be documenting my progress here.

What You'll Find Here:

Data Preprocessing: Techniques for cleaning, transforming, and preparing datasets for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations, statistical summaries, and other methods for uncovering insights from data.

Machine Learning: Implementations and experiments with various machine learning algorithms, both supervised and unsupervised.

Data Visualization: Visualizing data using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

Projects: Practical projects where I apply my skills to real-world datasets.

Tools and Libraries Used:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebooks for interactive learning

SQL for querying relational databases

TensorFlow and PyTorch for deep learning

I welcome contributions and feedback, as I'm continuously improving my skills and learning new techniques in the exciting world of data science!
