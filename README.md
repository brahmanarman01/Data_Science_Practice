# 📊 Data Analysis with Pandas

This repository documents my progress in learning **Pandas**, a powerful Python library for data analysis and manipulation. The code is based on tutorials (such as from CodeWithHarry’s Python course) and executed using **Google Colab**.

---

## 📚 What I'm Learning

- Installing and importing Pandas in Colab
- Reading data from CSV and Excel files
- Exploring datasets using `head`, `tail`, `describe`, `info`
- Selecting and slicing rows and columns
- Filtering and sorting data
- Handling missing data
- Creating new columns and modifying existing ones
- Grouping and aggregating data
- Exporting cleaned data to files

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3** (via Google Colab)
- **Pandas**
- *(Optional: NumPy, Matplotlib for extended use)*
